<h1>Work in Progress</h1><br>

To Anurag and Chetan: Send Rest Requests to "172.17.19.41/instaconsult/Slim/index.php/{param}". It will be available most of the time.



Hemant :: {Check the dump file to get an idea of the schema. All the logic and everything resides in Slim/index.php
 So the first login request will be like http://www.example.com/Slim/index.php/login.<br>

 Maybe open a new branch and start committing code to that branch(front end code)<br>

 Use a chrome plugin to send rest api requests<br>

 Also some browsers dont support put and delete requests apparently. http://docs.slimframework.com/#Routing<br>

 Please refer that on how to make those requests<br>
 }

The code quality now is very poor since being a novice I am experimenting with various methods. I dont want to waste time on write beautiful/easy to read code as of now.Once atleast a few modules are neatly working, I will organise stuff into libs, use redbeans, make functions. Please bear with this for sometime. Any doubt in the code, please PM me.

<h2>TODO: </h2>
Every 5 api I write, I will refactor and organise a little so that it doesnt get out of hand<br>
Make a middleware function or include some file for auth at every endpoint<br>
Add try and catch at every endpoint for error management(Also generate specific error also at some point{ask hemant})<br>
Read on slim webhooks and try to use this(later stage)<br>
Write a proper documentation for the api endpoints at later stage for the front end person
